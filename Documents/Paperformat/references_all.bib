		 Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) has been used for
		 scientific data management since 1988. HDF is used in
		 many disciplines and supported by public and commercial
		 software. NCSA is collaborating with NASA, the ASCI
		 project, and others to provide a new format and
		 library, HDF5, which addresses the needs of vastly
		 expanded computational and storage systems, including
		 massively parallel systems. The HDF5 data model is
		 simpler and more powerful than the existing HDF4 data
		 model. HDF5 offers improved performance by providing
		 storage options such as data compression and tiling.
		 Applications that drive HDF5 include applications on
		 the ASCI {"}teraflops{"} machines, Earth science data
		 management, and product model data exchange. I/O
		 performance testing and tuning plays a critical role in
		 the HDF5 project, particularly on I/O-intensive
		 platforms, such as the ASCI machines. The poster
		 provides details on the results of these activities.",

    Abstract = {PERCU is a comprehensive evaluation methodology for large-scale systems that expands Performance analysis to include Effective work dispatching, Reliability, Consistency, and Usability. The PERCU approach and its components can be used for initial system assessment as well as for on-going quality assurance of High Performance Computing (HPC) and other systems. PERCU leverages work that has to be done in traditional benchmarking and acquisition approaches by compositing existing data to gain additional insights. 

A key contribution is the Sustained System Performance (SSP) concept which uses time-to-solution for assessing the productive work potential of systems for an arbitrary set of applications. The SSP provides a fair way to compare systems deployed at different times and provides a method to assess sustained price performance in a comprehensive manner. This work also discusses the Effective System Performance (ESP) test, developed to encourage and assess improved job launching and resource management – both important aspects for a productive HPC system. Reliability is the third characteristic of a productive system. This work explores the major causes of failure for very large systems and suggests improved methods for a priori assessment of the reliability of HPC systems. Consistent execution of programs is a metric often overlooked in assessments, but is a key service quality feature. This work shows how lack of consistency impacts quality of service and defines approaches for assessing and improving consistency. Usability is discussed for completeness and as future work.

PERCU can be used, in all or part, and with a limitless scale of detail and effort. At its simplest, it is a framework for holistic evaluation. In its detail, it introduces a set of methods for measurement of key parameters that impact quality of service on HPC systems. The use and impact of each PERCU element is documented for multiple systems, mostly using systems evaluated at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Facility.},

		 Grid{'}5000 platform, a lightweight grid. The goal was
		 to make a rather simple experiment, and study how
		 difficult it was to carry out correctly. This means it
		 had to be correct, reproducible and efficient. The
		 paper shows that despite the precautions taken, many
		 parameters that could have an effect on the result were
		 at first overlooked. It also shows that benchmarking
		 plays a key role on making an experiment correct and
		 reproducible. The process is in the end extremely
		 tedious, and stresses the need for new tools to help
		 users. The contribution of this work is to present a
		 methodology to get correct results on grid
		 architecture, to identify relevant problems and to
		 propose an infrastructure that answers part of the
		 problems encountered during experiments. Additionally,
		 pieces of this infrastructure have been built and are
		 also presented.",

  abstract =	"The increasing complexity of available infrastructures
		 with specific features (caches, hyperthreading, dual
		 core, etc.) or with complex architectures
		 (hierarchical, parallel, distributed, etc.) makes it
		 extremely difficult to build analytical models that
		 allow for a satisfying prediction. Hence, it raises the
		 question on how to validate algorithms if a realistic
		 analytic analysis is not possible any longer. As for
		 some many other sciences, the one answer is
		 experimental validation. Nevertheless, experimentation
		 in Computer Science is a difficult subject that today
		 still opens more questions than it solves: What may an
		 experiment validate? What is a ``\emph{good
		 experiment}''? How to build an experimental environment
		 that allows for ``\emph{good experiments}''? etc. In
		 this paper we will provide some hints on this subject
		 and show how some tools can help in performing
		 ``\emph{good experiments}'', mainly in the context of
		 parallel and distributed computing. More precisely we
		 will focus on four main experimental methodologies,
		 namely real-scale experiments (with an emphasis on
		 PlanetLab and Grid'5000), Emulation (with an emphasis
		 on Wrekavoc) simulation (with an emphasis on SimGRID
		 and GridSim) and benchmarking. We will provide a
		 comparison of these tools and methodologies from a
		 quantitative but also qualitative point of view.",

		 provide forward progress for long running Condor jobs
		 even when machines are available for limited periods of

		 (i.e., outside of the Condor resource management

abstract = {Among existing grid middleware approaches, one simple, powerful, and flexible approach consists of using servers available in different administrative domains through the classical client-server or Remote Procedure Call (RPC) paradigm. Network Enabled Servers implement this model also called GridRPC. Clients submit computation requests to a scheduler whose goal is to find a server available on the grid. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of a middleware developed by the GRAAL team called DIET (for Distributed Interactive Engineering Tool-box). DIET is a hierarchical set of components used for the development of applications based on computational servers on the grid.},

In order to provide access to the whole data sample to all the world-wide dispersed physicists, CMS is developing a layer of software that uses the grid tools provided by the LCG project to gain access to data and resources and that aims to provide physicists with a user friendly interface for submitting analysis jobs. The GRID tools used are both those already available in the LCG-2 release and those being developed in gain access to data and resources and that aims to provide physicists with a user friendly interface for submitting analysis jobs. The GRID tools used are both those already available in the LCG-2 release and those being developed in the framework of the ARDA project.
